This post is part of an initiative to improve the available documentation of GEDCOM X. This particular post describes how death-like information found during a research activity might be represented using GEDCOM X.

## Summary

During research for Wong Aloiau (born 1848, Guangdong, China, son of Wong Hin Tai and Shee Chun, id [`https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/4:1:LDKP-MK3`](https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/4:1:LDKP-MK3)), a researcher visits a grave marker in Honolulu, Hawaii, and takes a digital photograph of the grave marker.  The marker is described by providing a title, citation, and other metadata. A transcription of the marker (which is in Chinese) is provided, as is a translation. Information about the name, birth, death, and burial is extracted from the marker. The extracted information is assembled together with information extracted from other records to aggregate what is presumed to be known about Wong Aloiau.

## Gathering the Information

A researcher visits the Manoa Chinese Cemetery (a.k.a. Lin Yee Chung Cemetery) in Honolulu, Hawaii and takes a photograph of the grave marker for Wong Aloiau. The following is the digital image of the marker:

#### Analyzing the Information

The researcher analyzes the grave marker within the context of the other records of Wong Aloiau she has found. She writes an analysis document that details her conclusions of the identity of Wong Aloiau.

## Representing the Information

The information gathered is represented using GEDCOM X as follows:

#### Create the GEDCOM X Root Document

All GEDCOM X information is contained within a "root" document. When the document is created, the software being used by the researcher provides information about who can be attributed the information.

The following snippet demonstrates how a root document is initialized in both XML and JSON. The information within the document is dated March 7, 2014 and attributed to a user named "Jane Doe" with an e-mail address of "example@example.org". An instance of the [`Agent`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#agent) data type is provided to describe the contributor, and an instance of the [`Attribution`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#attribution) data type is provided to attribute the information to the contributor.

#### The Source Descriptions

The source and its digial image are deach described by providing an instance of the [`SourceDescription`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#source-description) data type in the root document. The following snippet demonstrates how the sources are described in both XML and JSON. The source descriptions include a title, a citation, and a reference to the cemetery, which is represented using an [`Agent`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#agent).

#### The Extracted Information

The information that is extracted from the source is represented as persons and relationships. An instance of the [`Person`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#person) data type provides person information and an instance of the [`Relationship`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#relationship) data type provides relationship information.

The following snippet demonstrates how the extracted information is represented in both XML and JSON. Each person is designated as `extracted` because the information was extracted from a single source. Each person includes a name, an id, and a reference to the source. The birth information is included on the principal person, and the occupation information is included on the father.

#### The Analysis

Following good research process practices, the researcher writes up a document that describes her analysis of the information about Emma Bocock that was discovered. Presumably, other sources in addition to the birth record were located and their analysis would be included in the document.

The aggregated analysis, including the text of the document, is represented with another [`Person`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#person) that references the extracted information as evidence using instances of [`EvidenceReference`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#evidence-reference). The following snippet demonstrates how the analysis is represented in both XML and JSON.

## Code Examples

[This Java code example](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx-java/blob/master/gedcomx-model/src/test/java/org/gedcomx/examples/EmmaBocockExampleTest.java#L25), found in [`gedcomx-java`](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx) repository demonstrates how to produce the above result.

## Extra Credit

todo:

Here are some other elements that a GEDCOM X processor may want to provide. These items were left out of the above example for the sake of brevity.

* Multiple values for different languages may be provided for the title and citation of a source. In such a case, the "lang" property on each title and citation may be used to specify the language of the text using [BCP 47](http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47). For more information, see the section [about Internationalization Considerations](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#i18n). See also the [Source Description](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#source-description) data type and its associated representations in [XML](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/xml-format-specification.md#source-description) and [JSON](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/json-format-specification.md#source-description).
* In addition to the name of the repository, other information about the repository may be provided, such as address, web page, e-mail, phone number, etc. For more information, see the [Agent](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#agent) data type and its associated representations in [XML](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/xml-format-specification.md#agent) and [JSON](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/json-format-specification.md#agent).
* In addition to an analysis document for the researcher's conclusions about Emma Bocock, a researcher may also want to provide a document containing an analysis of the birth certificate itself, perhaps describing the informant, whether the source is primary or secondary, etc. For such purposes, the [Source Description](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#source-description) data type provides an `analysis` property that can resolve to an analysis [document](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#document).
* Some software allows the researcher to provide a digital image of the source that can be included in the data set and displayed along with the extracted information. In such a case, descriptions of _two_ sources would be provided: one for the physical birth certificate, and one for the scanned image of the birth certificate. The latter description would reference the former as a source using the `sources` property of the [Source Description](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#source-description), and reference the digital image by its URI using the `about` property. If the researcher wished to export the data, the digital image would be bundled up with the XML using the [GEDCOM X File Format](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/file-format-specification.md).
* When providing a name of a person, the software may wish to prompt the user for the parts of a name in addition to (or instead of) the full text of the name. In such a case, the parts can be provided using the `parts` property of the [Name](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#name) data type.
* When providing a date (such as the birth date), the software may wish to prompt the user for a specific "formalized" date value in addition to the text of the date of the birth certificate. In such a case, the formal date can be provided using the `formal` property of the [Date](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#date) data type, which conforms to the [GEDCOM X Date Format](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/date-format-specification.md).
* When providing information about a place, the software may be able to prompt the user for specifics about the place, such as it's jurisdictions, geo-coordinates, name variants, etc. In such a case, an instance of a [Place Description](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#place-description) can be provided in the document, which can be referenced using the `descriptionRef` property of the [Place Reference](https://github.com/FamilySearch/gedcomx/blob/master/specifications/conceptual-model-specification.md#conclusion-place-reference) data type.
* When writing an analysis document, some software may allow the researcher to apply fonts, formatting and styles. In such a case, the text of the document can specify a `textType` property with the value of "xhtml".
