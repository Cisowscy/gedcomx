For those of you who were unable to attend my GEDCOM X presentation at RootsTech 2014, I put together an abbreviation of that presentation as a screencast.

You're also welcome to [grab the slide deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_rHvCUg1mL6WHdmd042dk9xTlU/edit?usp=sharing).

RootsTech 2014 was a great experience. Thank you to everybody who participated to make it such a successful event. I am fortunate indeed to have the privilege of interacting with so many remarkable people who contribute to such meaningful work.
